# UI/UX Review â€“ Duolingo Web

## âœ… What Works Well
- Clear and friendly design
- Consistent color palette and typography
- Gamified experience keeps users engaged
- Easy navigation with clear call-to-action buttons
- Fast loading and responsive design

## ðŸ§  Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. Accessibility
- Contrast between background and text could be improved in some areas
- No visible focus outline when using keyboard navigation

### 2. Error Feedback
- Some error messages (e.g. invalid password) could be more specific
- No real-time validation on all form fields

### 3. Profile Settings
- Some settings (e.g. account deletion) are hard to find
- Profile edit options could be grouped more clearly

## ðŸ§ª Overall UX Score: 8.5/10
Great interface with strong engagement elements. Minor improvements in accessibility and feedback would make it excellent.
